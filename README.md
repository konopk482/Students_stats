# Students_stats

This project analyzes a student grading dataset to uncover patterns and factors that are related to students performance. Most important goal is to identify drivers of success, study habits, and demographic factors.

Tools used:
SQL (Finding trends and habits)
Excel (Data cleaning and formating)
Python (Little correlation)
Power BI (visualization)

Are there differences in performance based on gender or department?

Do study hours per week affect grades?

Does family income, parental education, or internet access have any correlation with grades?

Are stress levels and sleep patterns related to performance?
