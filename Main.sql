-- Correlation analysis in Python showed that only grades have an impact on grades, which turned out to be true. 
-- Therefore, there is no point in analyzing other columns in depth.

-- **Key Takeaways:**
-- 1. Attendance is very important for achieving better grades.
--    - Students with at least 80% attendance are very likely to get at least a B.  
--    - Students with less than 60% attendance are very likely to fail.  
-- 2. There is minimal impact on grades from stress, sleep, family income level, and other factors.  
-- 3. Even study hours per week have minimal impact on grades.  

-- **Summary:**
-- - The most important focus should be on boosting attendance.  
-- - Schools should implement a reward system for students who maintain at least 80% attendance.  
-- - Schools should offer more engaging and entertaining classes to encourage higher attendance.  
-- - Students should aim for at least 80% attendance, as it would practically guarantee them at least a B grade.  
-- - Schools should establish a support system for students with less than 60% attendance.  
-- - Teachers should be more flexible and understanding with students, which could help reduce stress levels.  
-- - Mental health support, including stress and sleep management programs, would benefit students.  
-- - The focus should be on the Computer Science (CS) department since it has the most students and the highest fail count.  
-- - More than 66% of students donâ€™t participate in extracurricular activities, so schools should create a system to encourage participation.
